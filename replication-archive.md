description: |
  3-agent replication package auditor, README generator, and archive builder.
  Agent A checks archive structure and documentation (README completeness
  against the SSDE template, folder layout, LICENSE, data availability
  statements). Agent B audits code reproducibility (master script, path
  management, dependency pinning, random seeds, batch mode, data pipeline
  integrity). Agent C verifies paper-archive alignment (table-to-script
  mapping, figure mapping, inline number tracing, appendix coverage).
  Produces a Completeness Dashboard and prioritized checklist. Fix modes
  generate missing documentation (README, LICENSE, table mapping, config
  file). Build mode constructs a complete replication package from a
  project directory — organizing files into standard folder structure,
  generating a master script, and creating all documentation.
  Supports AEA, AJPS, Nature, and general standards.

# Replication Archive

Audit a replication package against journal standards, generate missing documentation, or build a complete replication archive from a project directory. Three read-only agents examine the project in parallel; an optional fixer agent generates README, LICENSE, table mappings, and config files. In `build` mode, the skill constructs the entire archive: folder structure, master script, config file, and all documentation. Every finding is framed as what a human replicator would experience: "A replicator running this archive would encounter X because Y."

**What this skill does NOT cover** (use companion skills instead):
- Statistical methods and analytical correctness → `review-paper-code` or `statistical-reviewer`
- Writing quality and prose editing → `writing_editor`
- Abstract verification → `abstract-checker`

---

## Phase 0: Parse Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` left-to-right:

### Recognized journal standards

| Token | Standard | Key characteristics |
|---|---|---|
| `aea` | AEA Data Editor | Strictest. Code must run without manual intervention. Per-dataset Data Availability Statements with formal citations. Folder structure: `data/raw/`, `data/analysis/`, `code/`, `results/`. Clean-environment test required. LICENSE required (CC-BY 4.0 default). Full SSDE template README. |
| `ajps` | AJPS / APSR | Dataverse deposit. SSDE-compatible README. Code verification by journal staff. |
| `nature` | Nature / Springer Nature | Code availability statement in the paper. Code DOI required (Zenodo/Code Ocean, not just GitHub). Open-source license required. Data availability statement. |
| `general` | SSDE template baseline (default) | 7 required README sections. No journal-specific extras. |

(case-insensitive)

### Recognized fix modes

| Token | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `review` | Interactive item-by-item. For each generated file or fixable finding, display the content and ask the user to approve or skip. |
| `diff` | Generate all documentation and apply all fixes, then open VS Code for review. Git-tracked: Source Control. Not git-tracked: create `.replication-backup` copies and open `code -d backup file`. |
| `apply` | Generate all documentation and apply all fixes without opening VS Code. Headless. |
| `build` | **Construct a complete replication archive** from the project directory. Creates a new `replication-package/` directory with standard folder structure, copies code and data files into the correct locations, generates a master script, config file, README, and LICENSE. Runs the full audit afterward and reports remaining gaps. |

If no fix mode token is found, default to `report` (read-only — no files created or modified).

### Parsing rules

1. If a token matches a journal standard, store as `STANDARD`.
2. If a token matches a fix mode, store as `FIX_MODE`.
3. If a token looks like a directory path, store as `ARCHIVE_DIR`.
4. If a token looks like a `.tex`, `.qmd`, `.Rmd`, or `.md` file path, store as `PAPER_FILE`.
5. Defaults: `STANDARD` = `general`, `FIX_MODE` = `report`.
6. If no `ARCHIVE_DIR` is provided, use the current working directory.
7. If no `PAPER_FILE` is provided, auto-detect (see Phase 1).

Store: `ARCHIVE_DIR`, `PAPER_FILE`, `STANDARD`, `FIX_MODE`.

---

## Phase 1: Discover the Archive and Paper

### 1. Find the paper

If `PAPER_FILE` was provided, use it. Otherwise, auto-detect:

1. Use Glob for `**/*.tex`, `**/*.qmd`, `**/*.Rmd`, excluding `_minted-*`, `build/`, `output/`, `.git/`, `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `.quarto/`, `_site/`.
2. Identify the main document: `.tex` containing `\documentclass` or `\begin{document}`; `.qmd`/`.Rmd` containing YAML frontmatter with `title:`.
3. If multiple candidates, prefer `Writing/`, `Paper/`, `Draft/`, or root; then the file with the most `\input{}`/`\include{}`.
4. Read the main file and all referenced files.

### 2. Map the archive folder structure

Run `ls -R` or use Glob to build a complete tree of `ARCHIVE_DIR`. Categorize each directory:

| Expected directory | Purpose | Required by |
|---|---|---|
| `data/raw/` or `data/source/` | Original unmodified data | AEA (required), others (recommended) |
| `data/analysis/` or `data/derived/` | Processed analysis-ready data | AEA (required), others (recommended) |
| `code/` or `programs/` or `scripts/` | All code files | All |
| `results/` or `output/` or `tables/` + `figures/` | Generated outputs | All |

Record as `ARCHIVE_TREE`.

### 3. Find documentation files

Look for:
- README: `README.md`, `README.txt`, `README.pdf`, `README` (any case)
- LICENSE: `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md`, `LICENSE.txt`
- Dependency files: `requirements.txt`, `environment.yml`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `renv.lock`, `DESCRIPTION`, `Manifest.toml`, `Project.toml`
- Config files: `config.do`, `config.R`, `config.py`, `profile.do`, `paths.do`, `setup.R`
- Build files: `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`
- Citation: `CITATION.cff`, `CITATION.bib`

Record as `DOC_FILES`.

### 4. Find code files

Use Glob with patterns: `**/*.do`, `**/*.R`, `**/*.r`, `**/*.py`, `**/*.jl`, `**/*.m`, `**/*.sas`, `**/*.ipynb`, `**/*.Rmd`, `**/*.qmd`, `**/*.sh`, `**/*.bash`.

Exclude: `.git/`, `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `renv/`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `env/`.

Record as `CODE_FILES` with a count by language.

### 5. Find data files

Use Glob: `**/*.dta`, `**/*.csv`, `**/*.xlsx`, `**/*.xls`, `**/*.parquet`, `**/*.arrow`, `**/*.rds`, `**/*.rda`, `**/*.sav`, `**/*.sas7bdat`, `**/*.feather`, `**/*.json`, `**/*.tsv`.

Categorize by directory location:
- `DATA_RAW`: files in `data/raw/`, `data/source/`, `original-data/`, or similar
- `DATA_ANALYSIS`: files in `data/analysis/`, `data/derived/`, `analysis-data/`, or similar
- `DATA_OTHER`: files elsewhere

### 6. Find output artifacts

- Tables: `**/*.tex`, `**/*.csv`, `**/*.html`, `**/*.rtf`, `**/*.xlsx` in `results/`, `output/`, `tables/`, or similar
- Figures: `**/*.pdf`, `**/*.png`, `**/*.eps`, `**/*.svg`, `**/*.jpg` in `results/`, `output/`, `figures/`, or similar
- Logs: `**/*.log`, `**/*.smcl`

Record as `OUTPUT_FILES`.

### 7. Report discovery to user

Before proceeding, tell the user:
- Archive directory and paper file identified
- Folder structure summary (matches expected layout?)
- README: found? format?
- LICENSE: found?
- Code files: count by language
- Data files: count (raw vs. analysis vs. other)
- Output artifacts: count (tables, figures, logs)
- Dependency files found
- Journal standard being applied
- Fix mode

---

## Phase 2: Read the Paper and README

### Read the paper

Read `PAPER_FILE` and all included files. Extract:

- **Paper title and authors**
- **Every table**: number, caption, data source (`\input{}` path if LaTeX), location in text
- **Every figure**: number, caption, file reference, location in text
- **Appendix tables and figures**: same as above
- **Inline numbers**: statistics, sample sizes, coefficients, p-values, counts cited in running prose (not inside `\input{}` of a table file). Use grep for patterns like `$N = `, `\$[0-9]`, `[0-9]+\%`, `$p [<>=]`, `$\beta`, coefficient values.
- **Dataset names**: survey names, administrative data descriptions, any named data sources
- **Sample sizes**: every mention of N, sample size, or observation count
- **Robustness claims**: "as a robustness check," "results are robust to," "sensitivity analysis," appendix references to alternative specifications

Record as `PAPER_INVENTORY`:
- `TABLES`: list of (number, caption, input path if any)
- `FIGURES`: list of (number, caption, file reference if any)
- `INLINE_NUMBERS`: list of (value, context sentence, location)
- `DATASETS`: list of (name, description, location in text)
- `ROBUSTNESS_CLAIMS`: list of (claim, location)

### Read the README (if it exists)

Read the full README. Parse it against the SSDE template's 7 required sections:

1. **Overview**: Look for runtime estimate, output count, general description
2. **Data Availability and Provenance Statements**: Look for per-dataset entries with source, URL/DOI, access conditions, redistribution rights
3. **Computational Requirements**: Look for software names + versions, packages, hardware, OS, runtime
4. **Description of Programs/Code**: Look for a file listing with descriptions
5. **Instructions to Replicators**: Look for numbered steps, master script reference
6. **List of Tables and Programs**: Look for a table→script mapping
7. **References**: Look for data source citations

For each section, record: PRESENT (complete) / PARTIAL (exists but incomplete — note what's missing) / ABSENT.

Record as `README_ANALYSIS`.

---

## Phase 3: Launch 3 Agents in Parallel

In a **single message**, launch all 3 agents using the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`. Each agent reads source files independently. **No agent writes any file.**

Pass to each agent: all file paths discovered, `PAPER_INVENTORY`, `README_ANALYSIS`, `ARCHIVE_TREE`, `STANDARD`, and the relevant checklist.

---

### AGENT A — Archive Structure and Documentation

You are auditing a replication package's structure and documentation against the Social Science Data Editors (SSDE) template README standard. Read the archive files and assess completeness. **Do not write any files.**

Frame every finding as what a human replicator would experience. Not "Section 2 is incomplete" but "A replicator would not know where to obtain the Census data because the Data Availability Statement does not include access instructions."

Journal standard: `STANDARD`
Archive directory: `ARCHIVE_DIR`
Paper inventory: [insert `PAPER_INVENTORY`]
README analysis: [insert `README_ANALYSIS`]
Documentation files found: [insert `DOC_FILES`]
Archive tree: [insert `ARCHIVE_TREE`]

#### Checklist

**A1. README Existence and Format**

- Software names with exact version numbers? (e.g., "Stata 17 MP", "R 4.3.2", "Python 3.11.4")
- Required packages/libraries with versions?
- Hardware requirements if non-trivial (memory, storage, CPU/GPU)?
- Operating system(s) tested on?
- Total expected runtime (broken down by step if > 1 hour)?
- Any commercial software required?

Cross-reference against dependency files found (`requirements.txt`, `renv.lock`, etc.). Flag discrepancies.

**A5. SSDE §4 — Description of Programs/Code**
- Is there a listing of every code file with a one-line description of what it does?
- Is the listing organized by function (data cleaning → analysis → output generation)?
- Are dependencies between scripts documented (which must run before which)?

Cross-reference against `CODE_FILES`. Flag code files present in the archive but missing from the listing.

**A6. SSDE §5 — Instructions to Replicators**
- Is there a numbered, step-by-step sequence?
- Are there 5 or fewer steps (or a single master script)?
- Is the only manual step "set the root directory path in the config file"?
- Is it clear which script to run first?
- Are prerequisites stated (install software, obtain restricted data)?

**A7. SSDE §6 — List of Tables and Programs**
- Is there a mapping from each table/figure in the paper to: generating script, line number(s), output filename?
- Does the mapping cover ALL tables and figures including appendix?
- Does it cover inline numbers cited in the text?

Cross-reference against `TABLES` and `FIGURES` from the paper inventory. Flag paper items missing from the mapping.

**A8. SSDE §7 — References**
- Are all data sources formally cited with standard bibliographic references?

**A9. LICENSE**
- Does a LICENSE file exist?
- Is it an appropriate type for the standard? (AEA: CC-BY 4.0 default. Nature: open-source required.)
- Does it cover both code and data, or are they licensed separately?

**A10. Folder Structure**
- Does the archive follow a clear directory convention?
- Is there separation between raw data, processed data, code, and results?
- AEA-specific: are `data/raw/`, `data/analysis/`, `code/`, `results/` present or equivalent?
- Are there data files mixed into code directories or vice versa?

**A11. Standard-Specific Extras**
- AEA: Is there evidence of a clean-environment test? openICPSR deposit preparation?
- AJPS: Dataverse deposit metadata? Verification-ready format?
- Nature: Code availability statement in the paper text? DOI for code deposit (not just a GitHub URL)? Reporting checklist?

### AGENT B — Code Reproducibility

You are auditing whether a replicator could clone this archive and reproduce all results without manual intervention (beyond setting a root directory path). Read all code files and assess execution feasibility. **Do not write any files.**

Frame every finding as what a human replicator would experience. Not "Line 47 has a hardcoded path" but "A replicator on any machine other than the author's would get a 'file not found' error at line 47 of clean_data.do because the path `/Users/smith/Desktop/project/data/` is hardcoded."

Archive tree: [insert `ARCHIVE_TREE`]
Paper inventory: [insert `PAPER_INVENTORY`]

#### Checklist

**B1. Master Script / Entry Point**
- Does a master script exist? Look for: `main.do`, `master.do`, `run_all.R`, `main.R`, `main.py`, `run_all.py`, `Makefile`, `_targets.R`, or a script that calls all others.
- Does it call all other scripts in the correct dependency order?
- Does it run end-to-end without manual intervention?
- If no master script: can the run order be inferred from file numbering (e.g., `01_clean.do`, `02_analyze.do`)? Is this documented?

**B2. Path Management**
- Are all file paths relative to a single root variable or config file?
- List every hardcoded absolute path found. For each, note the file, line, and the path.
- Is there a config file where the replicator sets one root path? (e.g., `config.do`, `paths.R`, `config.py`)
- Do scripts create output directories before writing to them, or would they fail with "directory not found"?

**B3. Dependency Management**
- For each language used, is there a dependency specification file?
  - Stata: `_ado/` directory or install commands in master script
  - R: `renv.lock`, `DESCRIPTION`, or `install.packages()` calls
  - Python: `requirements.txt`, `environment.yml`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`
  - Julia: `Project.toml`, `Manifest.toml`
- Are versions pinned (exact version numbers, not just package names)?
- Cross-reference: for every `library()`, `import`, `ssc install`, etc. in code, is the package declared?
- Flag packages used but not declared, and packages declared but not used.
- Flag packages from non-standard repositories (GitHub installs, custom CRAN mirrors).

**B4. Random Seeds**
- For every stochastic procedure (sampling, bootstrapping, simulation, train/test split, MCMC, permutation test, jittering in plots, random forest, cross-validation), is a seed set BEFORE the call?
- Is there a global seed at the top of the master script?
- Flag: `set seed` / `set.seed()` / `np.random.seed()` / `random.seed()` / `torch.manual_seed()` calls and whether they precede the stochastic code.

**B5. Batch Mode / Non-Interactive Execution**
- Stata: any `browse`, `edit`, `pause`, `graph` without `nodraw`, `more` without `set more off`?
- R: any `readline()`, `menu()`, `locator()`, `X11()`, `quartz()`, `windows()` without file-device alternative? Any `View()` calls?
- Python: any `input()`, `plt.show()` without `plt.savefig()`, `breakpoint()`, `pdb.set_trace()`?
- Jupyter notebooks: any cells that depend on interactive execution order?
- General: any script that waits for user input or opens a GUI?

**B6. Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- Windows-style path separators (`\`) in code?
- OS-specific shell commands in scripts?
- File names that differ only by case (would collide on case-insensitive filesystems)?
- Non-UTF-8 file encodings or BOM markers?

**B7. Data Pipeline Integrity**
- For every data file that a script reads, is it either: (a) raw data included in the archive, (b) produced by a prior script, or (c) documented as externally obtained with access instructions?
- Are there circular dependencies (script A reads output of script B which reads output of script A)?
- Map the full pipeline: which script reads what and produces what. Identify any breaks.

**B8. Output Generation Completeness**
- Cross-reference `PAPER_INVENTORY` tables and figures against what the code would produce.
- For each table/figure: which script generates it? What is the output filename? Would it be written to the expected location?
- Flag tables/figures in the paper that have no generating code.
- Flag inline numbers that are not generated by any script (manually transcribed).

**B9. Error Handling and Logging**
- Stata: `set more off` at top? `capture noisily` or `assert` after merges?
- R: no global `tryCatch` that swallows errors silently? `stopifnot()` or assertions for critical data checks?
- Python: no bare `except:` or `except Exception: pass`?
- Are merge/join results checked (expected rows, many-to-one vs. many-to-many)?
- Is there logging of runtime, dataset dimensions, or key statistics?

**B10. Clean Environment Test**
- Is there evidence the archive was tested in a clean environment (fresh machine, empty library, no pre-existing files)?
- Is this documented in the README?
- Is there a Docker/container specification?
- AEA-specific: is a clean-environment test result documented?

### Execution Walkthrough

[Step-by-step narration of what happens when a replicator clones this archive and
tries to run it. Start from "The replicator opens the README..." and walk through
every step. Identify exactly where the pipeline would break and why. Be specific
about file names, line numbers, and error messages the replicator would see.

This is the most important section of your output. A replicator should be able to
read this walkthrough and know exactly what to expect.]

### Data Pipeline Map

[For each script, list: what it reads (inputs) → what it produces (outputs).
Mark any broken links where an input file is neither in the archive nor produced
by a prior script.]

### AGENT C — Paper-Archive Alignment

You are verifying that every empirical claim in the paper can be traced to a specific script and output file in the archive. This is the human replicator's roadmap — if this mapping is complete, a replicator knows exactly which script produces which result. **Do not write any files.**

Frame every finding as what a replicator would experience. Not "Table 3 is unmapped" but "A replicator looking for the code that produces Table 3 (regression results) would have no way to find it — no script in the archive appears to generate this output."

Journal standard: `STANDARD`
Paper inventory: [insert `PAPER_INVENTORY`]
Code files: [insert `CODE_FILES`]
Output files: [insert `OUTPUT_FILES`]
Archive tree: [insert `ARCHIVE_TREE`]
README analysis: [insert `README_ANALYSIS`]

#### Checklist

**C1. Table Mapping**

For EVERY table in the paper (main body AND appendix):
- Which script generates it? Search for: output file references, `esttab`, `outreg`, `stargazer`, `modelsummary`, `write.csv`, `to_latex`, `savefig`, table-writing commands.
- What line(s) in that script produce the output?
- What is the output filename?
- Does the output file exist in the archive?
- If the output file exists, do the column headers / variable names match the table in the paper?

**C2. Figure Mapping**

For EVERY figure in the paper (main body AND appendix):
- Which script generates it?
- What is the output filename?
- Does the output file exist in the archive?
- Does the figure file match what appears in the paper (same variables, same axes)?

**C3. Inline Number Tracing**

For numbers that appear in the paper prose (not inside `\input{}` of a table):
- Sample sizes ("N = 15,234"), percentages, summary statistics, key coefficients mentioned in text
- Can each be traced to a specific computation in the code?
- Is there a log file or saved scalar/variable that records it?
- Flag numbers that appear to be manually transcribed from output (high risk of transcription error)

**C4. Appendix Coverage**
- Are ALL appendix tables and figures generated by code in the archive?
- Are there appendix items with no corresponding code?
- Are there code outputs not mentioned in the paper or appendix? (Not a problem, but worth noting.)

**C5. Sample Size Consistency**
- Do N values stated in the paper match what the code's data loading and filtering steps would produce?
- If multiple samples are used (e.g., different subsets for different analyses), are they all documented?
- Flag discrepancies between paper-stated N and code-implied N.

**C6. Robustness Check Coverage**

For every robustness check or sensitivity analysis mentioned in the paper:
- Does corresponding code exist in the archive?
- Does the code match the description (same specification, same sample, same variables)?

**C7. Data Source Tracing**

For every dataset mentioned in the paper:
- Is it either: (a) included in the archive, or (b) documented in a Data Availability Statement with access instructions?
- Do variable names in the code match the data source descriptions in the paper?

## Phase 4: Synthesize

After all 3 agents return, consolidate their findings.

### 4.1 Cross-reference and deduplicate

Combine findings that flag the same underlying issue from different angles:
- Agent A "Data Availability Statement ABSENT for dataset X" + Agent C "Dataset X UNMAPPED" → single finding
- Agent B "Script Y reads data file not in archive" + Agent C "Table 3 UNMAPPED" → single finding
- Agent A "Instructions section ABSENT" + Agent B "No master script and run order unclear" → single finding

### 4.2 Assign severity tiers

Severity depends on the journal standard. The table below shows the **base** severity; when `STANDARD = aea`, items marked ★ are elevated one tier.

**CRITICAL** — Archive will be rejected or results cannot be reproduced:
- README absent or missing 3+ of 7 SSDE sections
- No master script AND no documented run order
- Main table or figure UNMAPPED (no generating script found)
- Hardcoded absolute paths throughout (archive won't run on another machine)
- Data files referenced by code but neither included nor documented as restricted
- Paper-archive numerical mismatch on a main result
- LICENSE absent (when required by standard: AEA, Nature)

**MAJOR** — Likely revision request:
- README missing key sections (runtime, computational requirements, table mapping)
- Dependencies not pinned (versions not specified) ★
- Random seeds missing for stochastic procedures ★
- Appendix table/figure UNMAPPED
- Interactive commands blocking batch execution ★
- Incomplete Data Availability Statements (some datasets undocumented)
- No evidence of clean-environment test ★
- Inline numbers not traceable to code

**MINOR** — Improves replicator experience:
- Folder structure doesn't follow convention (but archive still navigable)
- Minor documentation gaps (no hardware requirements when runtime < 10 min)
- Cross-platform warnings
- Missing logging/diagnostics
- Redundant output files
- Code style issues that don't affect execution

### 4.3 Triage hierarchy

missing code for main results > archive won't run > README absent/incomplete > data undocumented > dependencies unmanaged > appendix gaps > seeds missing > inline numbers untraced > style improvements.

### 4.4 Compile synthesis

- `ARCHIVE_HEALTH`: one of "Ready for submission" / "Minor revisions needed" / "Major revisions needed" / "Not submittable"
- `TOP_ACTIONS`: 5–10 concrete next steps, ordered by severity
- `COMPLETENESS_METRICS`: from agent outputs

## Phase 4b: Fix Mode Gate

*Skip this phase entirely if `FIX_MODE` is `report` (the default). Proceed directly to Phase 5.*

This skill's fixes are primarily **generative** — creating missing documentation rather than editing existing code. Build a fix plan from the synthesis.

### Auto-fixable (generative) categories

**1. Generate README**

If the README is absent or missing 3+ sections, generate a complete SSDE template README. Populate from discovered metadata:

```markdown
# Data and Code for: "[Paper Title]"

## Overview

**Authors:** [from paper]
**Date:** [current date]
**README last updated:** [current date]

This archive contains the data and code to replicate all tables, figures, and
in-text numbers in "[Paper Title]."

- **Runtime:** TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR
- **Tables produced:** [N, from paper inventory]
- **Figures produced:** [N, from paper inventory]

## Data Availability and Provenance Statements

[One subsection per dataset detected by agents:]

### [Dataset Name]

- **Source:** TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR
- **URL/DOI:** TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR
- **Access conditions:** [Public / Restricted / Purchased — infer if possible, else TO BE FILLED]
- **Included in this archive:** [Yes / No — check if data file exists]
- **Redistribution rights:** TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR
- **Citation:** TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR

## Computational Requirements

### Software

[For each language detected:]
- [Language] [version — TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR]
  - Packages: [list from dependency analysis, versions TO BE FILLED if not pinned]

### Hardware

- TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR

### Runtime

- TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR

## Description of Programs

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| [master script] | Master script. Runs all other scripts in sequence. |
| [each code file] | [auto-inferred from file name and comments, or TO BE FILLED] |

## Instructions to Replicators

1. Set the root directory path in `[config file]` to the location of this archive.
2. Install required packages: [language-specific instructions from dependency files].
3. Run `[master script name]`.
4. Outputs will be saved to `[output directory]`.

## List of Tables and Programs

| Table/Figure | Script | Line(s) | Output File |
|---|---|---|---|
[from Agent C's mapping]

## References

TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR — cite all data sources used.
```

Mark every "TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR" field clearly. These require author judgment and cannot be inferred.

**2. Generate LICENSE file**

If absent, generate based on standard:
- AEA: CC-BY 4.0 with author names and year
- Nature: MIT License (or CC-BY 4.0 if data included)
- General: MIT License

**3. Generate table/figure mapping**

If README §6 is absent, generate the mapping table from Agent C's analysis and insert it into the README (or create a standalone `TABLE_MAPPING.md`).

**4. Fix hardcoded absolute paths**

For each hardcoded path found by Agent B, replace with a relative path using a config variable. If no config file exists, create one first (see #6).

**5. Add missing random seeds**

Insert seed-setting calls before stochastic procedures:
- Stata: `set seed 12345` before `bsample`, `bootstrap`, `simulate`, `permute`
- R: `set.seed(12345)` before `sample()`, `boot()`, `replicate()`, `randomForest()`
- Python: `np.random.seed(12345)` / `random.seed(12345)` / `torch.manual_seed(12345)`

Use seed value `12345` as a placeholder. Add a comment: `// TO BE SET BY AUTHOR — choose a meaningful seed`.

**6. Create config file**

If no config file exists and paths are scattered across scripts, generate:
- Stata: `config.do` with `global root "TO BE SET BY AUTHOR"`
- R: `config.R` with `root <- "TO BE SET BY AUTHOR"`
- Python: `config.py` with `ROOT = "TO BE SET BY AUTHOR"`

**7. Add output directory creation**

Insert directory-creation guards before file writes:
- Stata: `cap mkdir "[dir]"`
- R: `dir.create("[dir]", recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)`
- Python: `os.makedirs("[dir]", exist_ok=True)`

**8. Add Stata housekeeping**

If Stata scripts lack standard preamble, insert at top of master script:
```stata
clear all
set more off
set maxvar 10000
```

### Not auto-fixable (recommend only)

- Writing Data Availability Statements for restricted data (requires author knowledge of access conditions)
- Filling in runtime estimates (requires actually running the code)
- Adding missing code for tables/figures (requires domain expertise)
- Restructuring folder hierarchy (too destructive)
- Clean-environment testing (requires actual execution)
- Verifying numerical accuracy (requires running the code)
- Describing data sources the agents cannot identify

### Fix plan structure

For each fixable item, record:
- **Type**: `GENERATE` (new file) or `EDIT` (modify existing file)
- **File path** (for GENERATE: the new file path; for EDIT: existing file path)
- **Content** (for GENERATE: full file content; for EDIT: `old_string` → `new_string`)
- **Reason**: what problem this fixes, in replicator-frame language
- **Severity**: CRITICAL / MAJOR / MINOR

Order: GENERATE items first (README, LICENSE, config), then EDIT items by severity.

### If `FIX_MODE` is `review` (interactive):

For each item in the fix plan:

1. Display: type, severity, file path, content preview (first 20 lines for GENERATE; full text for EDIT), and reason.
2. For GENERATE items: use AskUserQuestion: "Create this file? (yes / skip / stop)"
   - **yes** → Write the file using the Write tool.
3. For EDIT items: run `code -g FILE:LINE` to open VS Code, display the change, use AskUserQuestion: "Apply this fix? (yes / skip / stop)"
   - **yes** → Apply using Edit tool.
4. Track applied vs. skipped.

### If `FIX_MODE` is `diff` or `apply`:

Launch a **single fixer agent** (`subagent_type: "general-purpose"`) — the only agent with Write and Edit permissions.

> You are generating documentation and applying infrastructure fixes to a replication archive. Each item has been vetted by three audit agents. For new files, use the Write tool. For edits to existing files, use the Edit tool. Apply exactly what the fix plan specifies.
>
> **Fix plan:** [insert fix plan]
>
> **Rules:**
> 1. For GENERATE items: Write the complete file using the Write tool.
> 2. For EDIT items: Apply using the Edit tool with exact `old_string` and `new_string`.
> 3. If an `old_string` cannot be found, skip and report.
> 4. Do not modify analysis code logic. Only change infrastructure (paths, seeds, directory creation, housekeeping).
> 5. Preserve all "TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR" placeholders — do not guess at values.
> 6. Report: files created, edits applied, items skipped with reasons.

After the fixer agent returns:
- If `FIX_MODE` is `diff` and git-tracked: `code -g FILE:1` for each modified/created file; tell user to use Source Control (Cmd+Shift+G) for per-hunk revert.
- If `FIX_MODE` is `diff` and not git-tracked: for EDIT items, create `.replication-backup` copies before fixing, then `code -d backup file`. For GENERATE items, just open the new file.
- If `FIX_MODE` is `apply`: report changes summary only.

Record results as `FIX_RESULTS`.

---

## Phase 4c: Build Mode

*Skip this phase entirely unless `FIX_MODE` is `build`. If `FIX_MODE` is `build`, skip Phase 4b entirely and execute this phase instead.*

Build mode constructs a deposit-ready replication archive from the project directory. It uses the agent findings to make intelligent decisions about file placement, script ordering, and documentation content. The output is a self-contained `replication-package/` directory that a replicator can download and run.

### Step 1: Confirm with user

Before building, use AskUserQuestion to confirm:

> I will create a replication archive at `ARCHIVE_DIR/replication-package/` with this structure:
>
> ```
> replication-package/
> ├── README.md
> ├── LICENSE
> ├── code/
> │   ├── config.[ext]
> │   ├── master.[ext]
> │   └── [all code files]
> ├── data/
> │   ├── raw/       [X files]
> │   └── analysis/  [Y files]
> └── results/
>     ├── tables/
>     └── figures/
> ```
>
> **Code files:** [list]
> **Data files (raw):** [list — note any restricted data that will NOT be copied]
> **Data files (analysis):** [list]
> **Output directory:** results/ (will be empty — code regenerates these)
>
> Proceed? (yes / no)

If the user says no, fall back to `report` mode.

### Step 2: Create folder structure

Create the target directory tree using Bash `mkdir -p`:

```
replication-package/
├── code/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   └── analysis/
└── results/
    ├── tables/
    └── figures/
```

If `STANDARD = aea`, use exactly `data/raw/`, `data/analysis/`, `code/`, `results/`. For other standards, use the same layout (it is the clearest convention regardless of journal).

### Step 3: Copy files

Use Bash `cp` to copy files into the archive. **Never move or delete originals.**

**Code files:**
- Copy all files from `CODE_FILES` into `replication-package/code/`.
- Preserve any subdirectory structure within the code directory (e.g., if the project has `code/cleaning/` and `code/analysis/`, replicate that structure under `replication-package/code/`).
- Exclude: `.git/`, `__pycache__/`, `.Rhistory`, `.DS_Store`, `*.pyc`, `renv/library/`, `.venv/`, `node_modules/`.

**Data files:**
- Copy files from `DATA_RAW` into `replication-package/data/raw/`.
- Copy files from `DATA_ANALYSIS` into `replication-package/data/analysis/`.
- For files in `DATA_OTHER` (ambiguous location): use Agent B's data pipeline map to classify. If a file is read by the first script in the pipeline, it is raw. If it is produced by one script and consumed by another, it is analysis/intermediate. If unclear, place in `data/raw/` and flag for the author.
- **Do NOT copy** files that Agent A identified as restricted or confidential. Instead, create a placeholder file `replication-package/data/raw/RESTRICTED_[filename].txt` containing: "This file is not included due to access restrictions. See README §2 (Data Availability) for instructions on obtaining this data."

**Dependency files:**
- Copy `requirements.txt`, `renv.lock`, `environment.yml`, `DESCRIPTION`, `Project.toml`, `Manifest.toml`, or equivalent into `replication-package/code/`.

**Do NOT copy output files** into `results/`. The results directory should be empty — a valid replication archive regenerates all outputs from code + data. (Exception: if Agent B determined that certain outputs cannot be regenerated because the code is incomplete, copy them and flag in the report.)

### Step 4: Generate config file

Create a config file at `replication-package/code/config.[ext]` (where `[ext]` matches the primary language):

**Stata** (`config.do`):
```stata
* =============================================================================
* Configuration — SET THIS PATH BEFORE RUNNING
* =============================================================================
* Set `root` to the full path of the replication-package/ directory.
* Example: global root "/Users/yourname/replication-package"

global root "TO BE SET BY AUTHOR"

* Derived paths (do not edit)
global code    "$root/code"
global data    "$root/data"
global raw     "$root/data/raw"
global analysis "$root/data/analysis"
global results "$root/results"
global tables  "$root/results/tables"
global figures "$root/results/figures"
```

**R** (`config.R`):
```r
# ==============================================================================
# Configuration — SET THIS PATH BEFORE RUNNING
# ==============================================================================
# Set `root` to the full path of the replication-package/ directory.
# Example: root <- "/Users/yourname/replication-package"

root <- "TO BE SET BY AUTHOR"

# Derived paths (do not edit)
code_dir    <- file.path(root, "code")
data_dir    <- file.path(root, "data")
raw_dir     <- file.path(root, "data", "raw")
analysis_dir <- file.path(root, "data", "analysis")
results_dir <- file.path(root, "results")
tables_dir  <- file.path(root, "results", "tables")
figures_dir <- file.path(root, "results", "figures")
```

**Python** (`config.py`):
```python
# ==============================================================================
# Configuration — SET THIS PATH BEFORE RUNNING
# ==============================================================================
# Set `ROOT` to the full path of the replication-package/ directory.
# Example: ROOT = "/Users/yourname/replication-package"

from pathlib import Path

ROOT = Path("TO BE SET BY AUTHOR")

# Derived paths (do not edit)
CODE_DIR    = ROOT / "code"
DATA_DIR    = ROOT / "data"
RAW_DIR     = ROOT / "data" / "raw"
ANALYSIS_DIR = ROOT / "data" / "analysis"
RESULTS_DIR = ROOT / "results"
TABLES_DIR  = ROOT / "results" / "tables"
FIGURES_DIR = ROOT / "results" / "figures"
```

For multi-language projects, generate config files for each language.

### Step 5: Generate master script

Create a master script at `replication-package/code/master.[ext]` that runs all code files in the correct order. Use Agent B's data pipeline map and execution walkthrough to determine the ordering.

**Stata** (`master.do`):
```stata
* =============================================================================
* Master script — runs all code to replicate paper results
* =============================================================================
* Runtime: TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR
* Last verified: TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR
* =============================================================================

clear all
set more off
set maxvar 10000

* Load configuration
do "$root/code/config.do"

* Create output directories
cap mkdir "$results"
cap mkdir "$tables"
cap mkdir "$figures"

* --- Data cleaning ---
do "$code/[first_script].do"
do "$code/[second_script].do"

* --- Analysis ---
do "$code/[analysis_script].do"

* --- Tables and figures ---
do "$code/[output_script].do"

* =============================================================================
* Done. Check results/ for output files.
* =============================================================================
```

**R** (`master.R`):
```r
# ==============================================================================
# Master script — runs all code to replicate paper results
# ==============================================================================
# Runtime: TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR
# Last verified: TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR
# ==============================================================================

rm(list = ls())

# Load configuration
source("code/config.R")

# Create output directories
dir.create(tables_dir, recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)
dir.create(figures_dir, recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)

# --- Data cleaning ---
source(file.path(code_dir, "[first_script].R"))
source(file.path(code_dir, "[second_script].R"))

# --- Analysis ---
source(file.path(code_dir, "[analysis_script].R"))

# --- Tables and figures ---
source(file.path(code_dir, "[output_script].R"))

# ==============================================================================
# Done. Check results/ for output files.
# ==============================================================================
```

**Python** (`master.py`):
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Master script — runs all code to replicate paper results.
Runtime: TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR
Last verified: TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR
"""
import subprocess
import sys
from pathlib import Path

code_dir = Path(__file__).parent

scripts = [
    # --- Data cleaning ---
    "[first_script].py",
    "[second_script].py",
    # --- Analysis ---
    "[analysis_script].py",
    # --- Tables and figures ---
    "[output_script].py",
]

for script in scripts:
    print(f"\n{'='*60}")
    print(f"Running: {script}")
    print(f"{'='*60}\n")
    result = subprocess.run(
        [sys.executable, str(code_dir / script)],
        check=True,
    )

print("\nDone. Check results/ for output files.")
```

**Ordering logic:**
1. Use Agent B's data pipeline map: scripts that produce inputs for other scripts run first.
2. Within a dependency tier, use filename numbering if present (`01_`, `02_`).
3. Group by function: data cleaning → analysis → output generation.
4. Add comments marking each group.
5. If the ordering is uncertain, add a `# TODO: verify ordering` comment and flag in the report.

For **multi-language projects** (e.g., Stata for data cleaning, R for analysis), generate a shell script (`master.sh`) or Makefile that calls each language's scripts in order.

**Makefile** (for multi-language projects):
```makefile
# Master Makefile — runs all code to replicate paper results
# Runtime: TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR

.PHONY: all clean

all: data_cleaning analysis tables_figures

data_cleaning:
	cd code && stata-mp -b do clean_data.do

analysis:
	cd code && Rscript analysis.R

tables_figures:
	cd code && Rscript make_tables.R
	cd code && Rscript make_figures.R

clean:
	rm -rf results/tables/* results/figures/*
```

### Step 6: Update paths in copied code

Launch a **fixer agent** (`subagent_type: "general-purpose"`) to update paths in the copied code files. This agent has Edit permissions on files in `replication-package/` only.

> You are updating file paths in code that has been copied into a replication archive. The archive has this structure:
>
> ```
> replication-package/
> ├── code/        (all scripts are here)
> ├── data/raw/    (raw data)
> ├── data/analysis/ (processed data)
> └── results/     (output: tables/, figures/)
> ```
>
> A config file at `code/config.[ext]` defines: `root`, `code`, `data`, `raw`, `analysis`, `results`, `tables`, `figures`.
>
> **Task:** For each code file in `replication-package/code/`:
> 1. Replace every hardcoded absolute path with the corresponding config variable.
> 2. Replace every relative path that assumes a different directory structure with the config variable equivalent.
> 3. Add `source("code/config.R")` / `do "$root/code/config.do"` / `from config import *` at the top of each script if not already present.
> 4. Ensure output paths point to `results/tables/` or `results/figures/`.
> 5. Ensure data input paths point to `data/raw/` or `data/analysis/`.
>
> **Rules:**
> - Only modify files inside `replication-package/`.
> - Do not change analysis logic, variable names, or statistical methods.
> - If a path is ambiguous, leave it and add a comment: `/* TODO: verify this path */`.
> - Report every change made: file, line, old path, new path.
>
> **Hardcoded paths found by the audit:** [insert Agent B's hardcoded paths list]
> **Data pipeline map:** [insert Agent B's pipeline map]

### Step 7: Generate documentation

Generate the following files in `replication-package/`:

1. **README.md** — Use the same SSDE template from Phase 4b's auto-fixable category #1, but with the following improvements for build mode:
   - The Instructions to Replicators section references the generated `master.[ext]` and `config.[ext]` by name.
   - The Description of Programs section lists all files actually copied into `code/`.
   - The List of Tables and Programs section uses Agent C's mapping.
   - Data Availability Statements include placeholder entries for restricted data with the text from the placeholder files.

2. **LICENSE** — Same as Phase 4b's auto-fixable category #2.

3. **MANIFEST.md** — A file listing every file in the archive with its purpose:
   ```markdown
   # Archive Manifest

   ## code/
   - `master.do` — Master script. Runs all other scripts.
   - `config.do` — Configuration. Set root path here.
   - `01_clean_data.do` — Cleans raw survey data.
   - ...

   ## data/raw/
   - `survey_2020.dta` — Raw survey responses (N = 15,234).
   - `RESTRICTED_admin_records.txt` — Placeholder. See README §2.
   - ...

   ## data/analysis/
   - `analysis_sample.dta` — Cleaned analysis sample. Produced by 01_clean_data.do.
   - ...

   ## results/
   Empty. Populated by running master.do.
   ```

### Step 8: Run post-build audit

After building, re-run the audit mentally against the new archive. Check:
- Does the master script reference all code files in the correct order?
- Do all paths in the copied code resolve to files that exist in the archive?
- Are all data files referenced by code either present or documented as restricted?
- Does the README's table mapping match what Agent C found?

Record any remaining gaps as `BUILD_REMAINING_ISSUES`.

### Step 9: Report build results

Record as `BUILD_RESULTS`:
- Archive location: `ARCHIVE_DIR/replication-package/`
- Files copied: X code files, Y data files (Z restricted data placeholders created)
- Files generated: README.md, LICENSE, config.[ext], master.[ext], MANIFEST.md
- Path updates: X paths updated in Y files
- Remaining issues: [from Step 8]

---

## Phase 5: Write the Report

Save to: `replication_archive_[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

```markdown
# Replication Archive Audit: [Paper Title]

*Audited: [date] | Standard: [STANDARD] | Languages: [LANGUAGES] | Paper: [PAPER_FILE] | Archive: [ARCHIVE_DIR]*

---

## Archive Health: [Ready for submission / Minor revisions needed / Major revisions needed / Not submittable]

[3–5 sentences. Frame as: "A human replicator attempting to reproduce these results
would..." Lead with the strongest aspect of the archive. Then the most critical gap.
End with overall characterization.]

---

## Completeness Dashboard

| Metric | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|

## Build Summary

*Include only if `FIX_MODE` is `build`. Omit otherwise.*

**Archive location:** `replication-package/`

| Category | Count | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Code files copied | X | [list] |
| Raw data files copied | X | [list] |
| Analysis data files copied | X | [list] |

| Files generated | X | README.md, LICENSE, config.[ext], master.[ext], MANIFEST.md |
| Paths updated in code | X across Y files | |
| Remaining issues | X | [list — things the author must still do] |

**Next steps for the author:**
1. Search for "TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR" in README.md and fill in all fields.
2. Search for "TO BE SET BY AUTHOR" in config.[ext] and set the root path.
3. Search for "TODO" in code files for any paths or orderings that need verification.
4. Run the master script in a clean environment to verify end-to-end execution.
5. [Any remaining issues from the post-build audit.]

---

## Fixes Applied

*Include only if `FIX_MODE` is `review`, `diff`, or `apply`. Omit if `report` or `build`.*

| # | Type | File | Description | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | GENERATE | README.md | Complete SSDE template README | CRITICAL | Applied / Skipped |
| 2 | GENERATE | LICENSE | CC-BY 4.0 | MAJOR | Applied / Skipped |
| 3 | EDIT | clean.do:47 | Replace hardcoded path with config variable | CRITICAL | Applied / Skipped / Failed |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Summary:** X files generated, Y edits applied, Z skipped.

## Priority Action Items

Triage hierarchy: missing code for main results > archive won't run > README
absent/incomplete > data undocumented > dependencies unmanaged > appendix gaps >
seeds missing > inline numbers untraced > style improvements.

**CRITICAL** (must fix before submission):
1. ...

**MAJOR** (likely to trigger revision request):
4. ...

**MINOR** (improves replicator experience):
7. ...

---

## Recommended README

*Include in report mode as a reference the author can adopt. In fix modes where
the README was generated, note the path to the generated file instead.*

[If `FIX_MODE` is `report`: include the complete generated README text here so the
author can copy it. If a README was generated in fix mode: "See generated file at
[path]. Search for 'TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR' to find fields requiring your input."]

## Phase 6: Final User Message

After saving the report, tell the user:

1. **Report path** — where the report was saved
2. **Archive health** — one sentence
3. **Completeness dashboard** — the key metrics table
4. **Fixes / build results**:
   - If `build`: report archive location, files copied, files generated, paths updated. Remind to search for "TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR" and "TO BE SET BY AUTHOR". Recommend running the master script in a clean environment.
   - If `review`/`diff`/`apply`: what was generated (README, LICENSE, config), how many edits applied. Remind to search for "TO BE FILLED BY AUTHOR" in generated files.
5. **Top 5 priority action items** — from the CRITICAL and MAJOR tiers
6. **Counts**: X CRITICAL, Y MAJOR, Z MINOR findings
7. **Standard-specific note**: e.g., "AEA requires a clean-environment test — run your archive on a fresh machine before submitting" or "Nature requires a DOI for the code deposit — create a Zenodo release from the GitHub repo"
8. If `FIX_MODE` is `diff`: remind user to review changes in VS Code Source Control
9. If `FIX_MODE` is `report`: note that a recommended README is in the report appendix
10. If `FIX_MODE` is `build`: remind user that `results/` is intentionally empty — it gets populated when the master script runs
